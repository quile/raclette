# Raclette

This is something I'm writing for myself for a very specific purpose: to
retrieve audio from YouTube videos, derive useful information from the
metadata, and produce m4a/aac audio files that are tagged and can be
imported into iTunes.

# Why?

There's a wealth of classical music on YouTube and I want to listen to it
offline.  I don't feel like downloading all of these files and tagging them
myself; it seemed like a fun one-day-project to glue together some really
great tools to get it to do what I need.

# And?

Well, it's not designed to be open-ended and flexible; it's just
designed to do one job.  This means the code is pretty grim.
